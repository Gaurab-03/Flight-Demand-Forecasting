# Flight Demand Forecasting

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to forecast flight demand. Accurate demand forecasting can help airlines optimize seat allocation, pricing strategies, and overall resource management.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Flight_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing flight demand data for modeling.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualization of demand trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations among features.

- **Modeling**  
  Implementation of machine learning models such as regression and time-series forecasting to predict demand.

- **Evaluation**  
  Model performance assessment using error metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R²).

- **Visualization**  
  Plots for predicted vs. actual demand, error distributions, and trends over time.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## 📊Results

- Forecast accuracy metrics are displayed in the notebook.

- Visualizations highlight patterns in flight demand and compare model predictions with actual values.

- The final model can be extended for real-time demand forecasting.
